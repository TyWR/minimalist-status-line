# minimalist-status-line

This is a simple rework of the amazing [Moonfly Status Bar](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-statusline/blob/master/autoload/moonfly_statusline.vim). I simply removed some of the features to suit my current minimalist needs. On top, I simply integrated [Vim Bufferline](https://github.com/bling/vim-bufferline) to have all of my buffer displayed on the status line.
